### üéØ What Stays The Same

- **Target Audience:** Gen Z/Alpha university students
- **Core Features:** Transcription, AI chat, duck companion, productivity tools
- **Tech Stack:** Electron + React + TypeScript + OpenAI + Supabase
- **Pricing:** $20/month Pro, $35/month Premium, Free tier
- **Timeline:** Ship MVP in 4 weeks
- **Economics:** 77% gross margin on Pro tier

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **This Week:**
   - Check if duck4u.com is available (~$12/year)
   - Start designing custom duck sprite animations
   - Set up initial Electron + React boilerplate

2. **Animation Creation:**
   - Decide on style: pixel art, vector, or mixed
   - Create walk cycle (8-12 frames)
   - Create idle animations (scratching, looking around)
   - Create interaction states (happy, listening, thinking)
   - Export as sprite sheet or individual PNGs

3. **Week 1 Development:**
   - Follow QUICK_START.md Day 1-2 instructions
   - Set up project structure
   - Integrate custom duck animation into frameless window
   - Implement basic duck behaviors

### üí° Animation Tips

**Tools You Can Use:**
- **Aseprite** ($20, best for pixel art)
- **Procreate** (iPad, great for frame-by-frame)
- **Adobe Animate** (vector animations)
- **Blender** (if you want 3D rendered to 2D sprites)
- **Krita** (free, good for digital animation)

**Sprite Sheet vs Individual Frames:**
- **Sprite Sheet:** Better performance, one file, requires CSS/Canvas
- **Individual Frames:** Easier to manage, larger file count

**Recommended Approach:**
- Create animations at 24fps (smooth enough)
- Export at 2x resolution for retina displays
- Use PNG with transparency
- Keep file sizes under 500KB total

### üìä Cost Savings

**Before (Lottie approach):**
- Commission animation: $50-200
- lottie-web package: 0 cost (but dependency)
- **Total: $50-200**

**After (Custom approach):**
- Your time creating animation: $0 (but takes 2-5 hours)
- No external dependencies: $0
- Full control over design: Priceless
- **Total: $0**

**Trade-off:** Your time vs money. Since you're creating it yourself, you save $50-200 but invest 2-5 hours of design work.

## Summary

All documentation has been updated to reflect **Duck4u** as the project name and **custom animations** as the approach. The core product strategy, economics, and timeline remain unchanged.

**You're ready to start building!** ü¶Ü

Check duck4u.com availability and start designing your duck. Follow QUICK_START.md for the 4-week development plan.

Good luck! üöÄ
