https://desktop-goose.en.softonic.com/?ex=RAMP-3582.3&rex=true reference but this one only for fun and distraction, while mine will be for efficiency and focus and support

I want to create sort of a Desktop overlay mini Ducky companion that will be able to interract with a person via clicking on the Ducky.

features: can listen to your lectures, take notes, help study and work.
- listens to the surroundings via your pc when you ask it to do so and writes down everything that was spoken into a file in DEsktop app. 
- has a Duckly AI chat where you can ask it questions as if you speak to AI, ask questions about whats going on on the screen and how to do certain task.
- also can act as antistrees pc pet which you can feed, click, and interact as with your own little friend during hard times.
- most of the time duck will be walking on your screen, or if you choose to it will stay in one place on the screen or can be a deafult desktop app that you open when needed, it will be in settings how you want it to be working for people who just need efficiency tools, but not a duck pet.
- Duck Pomodoro timer, periods, tracking, notes and etc for focus and efficiency working.
- yellow duck for programmers model
- can act as a conversation partner

how i see it. 
the duck pet walks on your screen from time to time, has animations of just wondering, scrapping its back with mouth, making asmost silent duck sweet sounds with interwals and animation of duck opening mouth.
When user clicks on the duck by cursor it opens a small window with chat input (with field to ask question, option to record sounds from microfone) near it and stops moving and just looks at you with friendly intention
