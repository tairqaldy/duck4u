# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

### 3. **Control Panel (Mini Window)** 🎛️
**Purpose:** Hub for all duck interactions

**Design:**
- Small window (300px × 400px) that appears next to duck when clicked
- Blurred glass-morphism background (modern aesthetic)
- Tabs/sections:
  - **Chat:** AI chat interface
  - **Record:** Lecture transcription controls
  - **Stats:** Study time tracking (simple timer)
  - **Settings:** Duck behavior, audio settings, file paths

**Chat Section:**
- Text input field at bottom
- Microphone button for voice input (uses Web Speech API for command recognition)
- Chat history displays above
- "See Screen" toggle button (activates computer vision mode)
- Example prompts:
  - "Summarize my last lecture notes"
  - "Quiz me on [topic]"
  - "What's on my screen?" (if screen vision enabled)

**Record Section:**
- Big "Start Recording" button
- Live transcription preview (last 100 characters)

- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Duck4u = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

**Colors:**
- Primary: Warm yellow (#FFD93D) - friendly, energetic
- Secondary: Soft blue (#6BCF9B) - calming, productive
- Background: Light mode default, dark mode available
- UI: Glass-morphism effects (blurred backgrounds, subtle shadows)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Inter Bold
- Body: Inter Regular
- Code/Transcripts: JetBrains Mono

**Duck Design:**
- Rubber duck aesthetic (classic yellow)
- Big friendly eyes
- Round, non-threatening proportions
- Smooth animations (no jerky movements)

---

### **UX Principles**

1. **Non-intrusive:** Duck should feel helpful, not annoying
2. **Quick access:** One click to open control panel, one click to start recording
3. **Clear feedback:** Always show what's happening (recording indicator, AI thinking state)
4. **Forgiving:** Easy to undo, delete, or retry actions
5. **Delightful details:** Smooth animations, satisfying sounds, easter eggs

## 🧪 User Research & Validation Plan

### **Pre-Launch (During Development)**

**Week 2:** Show Figma mockups to 10 students
- Question: "Would you use this? What's confusing?"
- Goal: Validate UI/UX before building

**Week 4:** Beta test with 20 students (hand-picked)
- Give free Pro access for 2 weeks
- Track usage daily
- Exit interview: "What worked? What didn't?"

---

### **Post-Launch (Month 1-3)**

**Surveys:**
- Send after 3 days: "What's your first impression?"
- Send after 14 days: "What's missing?"
- Send after 30 days: "Would you pay for this?"

**User Interviews:**
- Talk to 5 power users monthly
- Talk to 3 churned users monthly
- Ask: "What would make this 10x better?"

**A/B Tests:**
- Landing page variations (conversion rate)
- Freemium limits (impact on conversion)
- Duck behavior (user preference)

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Creating custom animation yourself (confirmed)

7. **Name:** Duck4u (duck4u.com domain - check availability)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀
