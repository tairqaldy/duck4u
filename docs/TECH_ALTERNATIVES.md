## üí° When to Switch

**Don't switch before MVP ships.** Use the recommended stack even if it's not perfect.

**Consider switching when:**
1. **Costs are killing margins** ‚Üí Switch to cheaper AI (GPT-4 ‚Üí Gemini Pro)
2. **Bundle size complaints** ‚Üí Switch to Tauri
3. **Performance issues** ‚Üí Switch to local Whisper
4. **Privacy becomes selling point** ‚Üí Switch to local LLM (maybe)

**The best tech is the tech you ship with.** Don't bikeshed.

---

## ü§î Questions?

If you're unsure which tech to use, ask yourself:

1. **Do I need to ship fast or optimize?** (Ship fast = use recommended stack)
2. **Do I know this tech already?** (If yes, use what you know)
3. **Will this decision matter in 6 months?** (If no, don't overthink it)

**When in doubt, stick with the PRD recommendations.** They're chosen for a balance of speed, cost, and reliability.

---

**Remember: The goal is to ship and learn, not to build the perfect architecture.** üöÄ
