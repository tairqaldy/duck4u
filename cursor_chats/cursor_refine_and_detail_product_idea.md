**User**

what you think about this idea? roast it adding more details and making more complete prd that can be later implemented think about how to make it and which which technologies. Ask me questions in the process to adjust scope.

**Cursor**

I'll read your brainstorm file to understand your idea first.

Okay, let me give you some honest feedback on "Portflow AI" (the productivity duck companion) and help you flesh this out into something actually buildable. 🦆

## The Roast 🔥

**The Good:**
- The contrast with Desktop Goose (distraction vs productivity) is smart positioning
- Combining productivity tools with emotional support is genuinely interesting
- Multiple modes (pet vs static app) shows you're thinking about different user preferences

**The Reality Check:**
1. **You're building 5 apps in one:** A screen overlay pet, a transcription service, an AI chatbot with computer vision, a gamified pet simulator, AND a Pomodoro tracker. Pick your battles.

2. **The "it does everything" trap:** When an app does everything, it often does nothing well. What's the CORE value prop? Is it the cute duck or the productivity tools?

3. **Screen overlay + always-on = battery/performance nightmare:** Users will uninstall if their laptop fan starts sounding like a jet engine.

4. **Lecture transcription is crowded:** Otter.ai, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet already do this well. What's your unique angle?

5. **Screen reading AI requires serious permissions:** Users are increasingly privacy-conscious. A duck that "sees everything" is creepy without crystal-clear boundaries.

## Questions to Define Scope:

**1. Target Audience:**
- Are you targeting students (lectures), knowledge workers (meetings), or both?
- Age range? (Gen Z loves cute pets, professionals might find it unprofessional)
- What's their primary pain point: loneliness while working, poor note-taking, lack of focus, or burnout?

**2. Core Feature Priority:**
- If you could ONLY ship with ONE feature bundle, which would it be:
  - A) Transcription + AI study assistant
  - B) Pomodoro timer + productivity tracking + duck pet
  - C) AI chat that can see your screen and help with tasks
  - D) Anti-stress companion with feeding/interaction

**3. Technical Constraints:**
- Desktop only or eventually mobile?
- Windows, Mac, Linux, or all three?
- Are you okay with requiring internet connection, or does it need offline mode?
- Budget for AI API calls (GPT-4 Vision gets expensive FAST with screen capture)

**4. Monetization:**
- Free with limited features? Subscription? One-time purchase?
- What would people actually pay for here?

**5. MVP Definition:**
- What's the MINIMUM version that would make ONE type of user's life better?
- What can you ship in 4-6 weeks vs 6 months?

**6. Screen Interaction:**
- Should the duck actually WALK around and potentially cover important content, or should it stay in designated safe zones?
- How do you handle multi-monitor setups?

**7. Privacy & Trust:**
- When it "listens to lectures" - is it always recording, or only when activated?
- When it "sees your screen" - what data is sent to servers vs processed locally?
- How do you make users trust this thing with potentially sensitive info?

---

## My Initial Tech Stack Recommendation:

**For Windows (which you're on):**
- **Framework:** Electron or Tauri (Tauri is lighter, Rust-based, better performance)
- **Pet Animation:** Lottie animations or CSS/WebGL sprites
- **Overlay:** Native OS APIs (harder but better performance) or frameless Electron window
- **Transcription:** Whisper API (OpenAI) or local Whisper model
- **AI Chat:** OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude API
- **Screen Capture:** Native screen capture APIs with explicit user permission
- **Pomodoro/Tracking:** Local SQLite database
- **Voice Input:** Web Speech API or Whisper

**Answer my questions above and I'll create a proper PRD with realistic phases for implementation!** 🚀

**User**

core value prop is cute duck and productivity tools, focusing on note-taking and desktop assistant
unique angle is that it workes even not while the some meeting is going on your device, but when you seet on lectures you also can turn it on and take notes.
Duck is positioned as friendly tool and we will set up boundaries that it records only when you allow so not always.

target audience: Gen Z/Alpha, targeting students (Bachelor/Masters) 
pain point:  loneliness while working/studying, poor note-taking,  lack of focus
f you could ONLY ship with ONE feature bundle, which would it be: A) Transcription + AI study assistant C) AI chat that can see your screen and help with tasks D) Anti-stress companion with feeding/interaction
Desktop only
Windows,Mac Linux, if possible (for now Windows)
Internet Connection is unnecessary, but for some tools, AI, or something else required. (partially both)
Budget is 20$ for subscription on this duck per user, we need to optimize screen capture feature so that it workes only if user starts working with this feature and has limits per day/week. 
It will be subscription based, with freemium (free some features limited.) with auth and this stuff.
People will pay for AI features, computer vision and customization.
I think that we can ship the minimal version of duck companion and note taking feature under a month and then proceed with idea validation and idea collection and even monetization even with MVP, then decide on adding more features.
it should stay in designed safe zones
multimonitor setup will require dragging the application window, aka rubber duck to needed monitor to work in certain place. (just an udea)
when listens to lectures it records when activated
when sees yout screen the whole screen share is processed on the servers outside of the computer.
we will say that it is not saving your data on external servers, just processes and shares it back.

initial tech stack (save options for later if i would like to switch for better performance, but now i just choose what i like from first glance)
framework Electron
Per animation: i like the Lottie, if we will be able to make it, its nice. CSS/WebGL also alright
Overlay: frameless Electron window
Transcription: Local Whisper model i guess.
AI Chat: OpenAI GPT-5
Screen Capture:  Native screen capture APIs with explicit user permission
Pomodoro/Tracking Local SQLite database
Voice input: Web Speech API? if its better then this, if not then Whisper, im not sure.

# Portflow AI - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Portflow AI is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Portflow adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Portflow works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 👥 Target Audience

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (Lottie animations) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Lottie-web for animations
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- CSS animations for smooth movement
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted

- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**

**Technical:**
- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

**Duck Design:**
- Rubber duck aesthetic (classic yellow)
- Big friendly eyes
- Round, non-threatening proportions
- Smooth animations (no jerky movements)

---

### **UX Principles**

1. **Non-intrusive:** Duck should feel helpful, not annoying
2. **Quick access:** One click to open control panel, one click to start recording
3. **Clear feedback:** Always show what's happening (recording indicator, AI thinking state)
4. **Forgiving:** Easy to undo, delete, or retry actions
5. **Delightful details:** Smooth animations, satisfying sounds, easter eggs

---

## 🧪 User Research & Validation Plan

### **Pre-Launch (During Development)**

**Week 2:** Show Figma mockups to 10 students

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

## Budget Breakdown (First Month)

| Item | Cost | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **Duck Animation (Lottie)** | $50-200 | Need quality animation |
| **Domain (portflow.ai)** | $12/year | Branding |
| **Supabase Free Tier** | $0 | 50K users, enough for beta |
| **OpenAI API (testing)** | $100-300 | Transcription + chat during testing |
| **Stripe** | $0 (2.9% per transaction) | Only pay when you make money |
| **Landing Page Hosting** | $0 | Use Vercel free tier |
| **Total Upfront:** | **$162-512** | |

**After launch, monthly costs scale with users (~$3 per paid user)**

---

## When Things Go Wrong

### "Electron is too hard"
→ Use Tauri instead (smaller, Rust-based)
→ Or just build a web app first (no offline features)

### "Whisper.cpp won't compile"
→ Use cloud Whisper API only (simpler, costs $$$)

### "No one signs up"
→ Your landing page sucks. Improve copy, add video
→ Or you're targeting wrong audience. Talk to users.

### "People sign up but don't use it"
→ Onboarding is broken. Add tutorial.
→ Or product isn't valuable. Ask why they left.

### "People use it but don't pay"
→ Freemium limits too generous. Tighten them.
→ Or paid features not compelling. Add screen vision.

## 💡 When to Switch

**Don't switch before MVP ships.** Use the recommended stack even if it's not perfect.

**Consider switching when:**
1. **Costs are killing margins** → Switch to cheaper AI (GPT-4 → Gemini Pro)
2. **Bundle size complaints** → Switch to Tauri
3. **Performance issues** → Switch to local Whisper
4. **Privacy becomes selling point** → Switch to local LLM (maybe)

**The best tech is the tech you ship with.** Don't bikeshed.

---

## 🤔 Questions?

If you're unsure which tech to use, ask yourself:

1. **Do I need to ship fast or optimize?** (Ship fast = use recommended stack)
2. **Do I know this tech already?** (If yes, use what you know)
3. **Will this decision matter in 6 months?** (If no, don't overthink it)

**When in doubt, stick with the PRD recommendations.** They're chosen for a balance of speed, cost, and reliability.

---

**Remember: The goal is to ship and learn, not to build the perfect architecture.** 🚀

**The Reality:** Free users cost you money. At 10,000 free users, you're spending **$7,800/month** to support them.

**Why this is okay:**
1. **Freemium funnel:** Free users convert to paid over time
2. **Word of mouth:** Free users bring in paid users
3. **Data & feedback:** Free users help improve product
4. **Scale efficiency:** Costs drop as you negotiate better rates

**When to worry:**
- If conversion rate drops below 3% → tighten free tier limits
- If free users don't convert after 90 days → they never will, consider limits

---

## 🎯 Break-Even Analysis

**Question:** How many users do you need to break even?

### Fixed Costs (Monthly):
- Server/infrastructure: $100-500
- Tools (Figma, analytics, etc.): $50
- Your time: (not counted for MVP, but eventually you'll want salary)

**Minimum Revenue Needed:**
- Fixed costs: ~$500/month
- Variable costs: ~$3,000/month (for 3,000 free users at early stage)
- **Total: $3,500/month to break even**

**Required Paid Users:**
- If only Pro ($20/mo, $15 profit): **233 paid users**
- Mix of Pro + Premium (avg $17 profit): **206 paid users**

**Required Total Users (at 5% conversion):**
- **206 ÷ 0.05 = 4,120 total users to break even**

**Conclusion:** You need ~4,000-5,000 users to stop losing money. Achievable in Month 3-4 if growth is good.

## 📉 Optimization Strategies (Phase 2+)

### 1. **Local Whisper Option**
**Savings:** $1.80/user/month (for Pro users who opt in)  
**Implementation Cost:** 2 weeks of dev time  
**ROI:** At 500 Pro users with 50% adoption = $450/month saved

### 2. **GPT-4-turbo-mini for Simple Tasks**
**Savings:** ~$0.10/user/month  
**Implementation:** Use mini for: greetings, simple questions, summaries  
**ROI:** At 550 paid users = $55/month saved (small but easy win)

### 3. **Aggressive Caching**
**Savings:** ~$0.20/user/month (reduce duplicate AI calls)  
**Implementation:** Cache common questions, transcript patterns  
**ROI:** At 550 paid users = $110/month saved

### 4. **Annual Plans (15% discount)**
**Impact:** Get 12 months revenue upfront  
**Cash flow boost:** Sell $20/mo → $204/year (instead of $240)  
**User saves $36, you get cash now for growth**

### 5. **Tighten Free Tier After Validation**
**Current:** 60 min/month transcription  
**Optimized:** 30 min/month (still generous for testing)  
**Savings:** $0.18/free user/month × 10,000 = $1,800/month

---

## 📈 Growth Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Organic (Product Hunt, Reddit, Word of Mouth):**
- Cost: $0 (just your time)
- CAC: $0
- This is your growth strategy for first 6 months

**Paid Ads (Later, if needed):**
- Facebook/Instagram ads: $50-100 per paid customer (typical for SaaS)
- Google Search ads: $30-80 per paid customer
- TikTok ads: $20-40 per paid customer (best for Gen Z)

**Payback Period:**
- If CAC = $50 and monthly profit = $15/user
- Payback in 3.3 months
- **Must retain users for 6+ months to be profitable**

---

## 🎓 Student Discount Strategy

**Idea:** Offer 50% off for students with .edu email

**Pro Tier Student:** $10/month (instead of $20)

**Economics:**
- Revenue: $10
- Costs: $4.56
- Profit: $5.44/month (54% margin)
- Still profitable! ✅

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower ARPU (average revenue per user)
- But higher conversion rate (students are price-sensitive)
- More users = more word of mouth

**Recommendation:** Test 50% student discount in Month 3-4 if conversion is low

---

## 🏫 University Site License (Future Revenue Stream)

**Idea:** Sell to universities for all students

**Pricing:** $5/student/year (deeply discounted)

**Example:** Mid-size university with 20,000 students
- Revenue: 20,000 × $5 = **$100,000/year**
- Costs: 20,000 × $4 (annual) = $80,000
- Profit: $20,000/year (20% margin)

**Why universities would buy:**
- Supports student success (better note-taking = better grades)
- Modern, appealing tool (improves student satisfaction)
- Privacy-focused (not selling student data)
- Cheaper than Otter.ai or Notion AI for entire campus

**When to pursue:** Month 6+ after product is polished and has testimonials

---

## 📊 Real Numbers Examples

### Example 1: Modest Success (Realistic Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 10,000 total users
- 500 Pro ($20/mo)
- 50 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $11,750**
- **Costs: $11,040**
- **Net: $710/month = $8,520/year**

**Your salary:** $0 (reinvest in growth)  
**Runway:** Can operate indefinitely without outside funding

---

### Example 2: Good Success (Optimistic Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 25,000 total users
- 1,250 Pro ($20/mo)
- 125 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $29,375**
- **Costs: $24,000** (economies of scale, better rates)
- **Net: $5,375/month = $64,500/year**

**Your salary:** $40,000/year (livable)  
**Remaining:** $24,500 for growth, team, or profit

---

### Example 3: Exceptional Success (Viral Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 100,000 total users
- 5,000 Pro ($20/mo)
- 500 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $117,500**
- **Costs: $85,000** (negotiated rates, mix of local/cloud processing)
- **Net: $32,500/month = $390,000/year**

**Your salary:** $100,000/year  
**Team:** Hire 2 engineers ($80K each)  
**Profit:** $50,000/year to reinvest

**This is venture-scale. You could raise a seed round at ~$5M valuation.**

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: OpenAI Raises Prices
**Current:** GPT-4-turbo is $0.01/1K tokens  
**If they raise to:** $0.02/1K tokens (2x)  
**Impact:** Costs per user double → margins compressed

**Mitigation:**
- Build in Claude as backup (competition keeps prices down)
- Move to local models for simple tasks
- Increase prices (users understand AI costs)

---

### Risk 2: Free Users Explode Without Conversions
**Scenario:** 50,000 free users, but only 1% convert (not 5%)  
**Costs:** 50,000 × $0.78 = $39,000/month  
**Revenue:** 500 paid × $20 avg = $10,000/month  
**Net: -$29,000/month** ❌ (Burning cash fast!)

**Mitigation:**
- Tighten free tier immediately (30 min → 15 min transcription)
- Add more paywalled features (flashcards, export, duck customization)
- Email campaigns to convert free users
- Consider killing free tier entirely and going paid-only (risky but stops bleeding)

---

### Risk 3: Churn is Higher Than Expected
**Healthy Churn:** 3-5% per month  
**Bad Churn:** 10%+ per month

**If 10% churn:** You need 10% new paid users/month just to stay flat

**Mitigation:**
- Exit interviews (ask why they left)
- Win-back campaigns (discount to return)
- Add features that increase stickiness (cloud sync, integrations)
- Annual plans (lock in for 12 months)

---

## 🧮 Quick Calculator

**Use this formula to estimate your costs:**

```
Monthly Cost = 
  (Free Users × $0.78) +
  (Pro Users × $4.56) +
  (Premium Users × $9.19) +
  Fixed Costs ($500)
```

**Monthly Revenue =**
```
  (Pro Users × $20) +
  (Premium Users × $35)
```

**Monthly Profit = Revenue - Costs**

**Gross Margin % = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100**

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Free users are expensive** ($0.78/month) but necessary for growth
2. **Pro users are profitable** (77% gross margin) and your main revenue
3. **Premium users are very profitable** (74% margin despite higher usage)
4. **You need ~4,000-5,000 total users to break even** (at 5% conversion)
5. **Unit economics work** if you can keep users for 6+ months
6. **Optimization matters** at scale (local Whisper saves $9K+/year at 500 users)
7. **Stripe fees hurt** ($0.88 per $20 transaction = 4.4%) but unavoidable
8. **Main cost driver is AI** (Whisper + GPT-4), so optimize this first

---

## 💡 Pricing Experiments to Try

### Experiment 1: Raise Pro to $25/month
**Hypothesis:** Students will pay for quality  
**Test:** Raise price for new users, keep existing at $20  
**Win if:** Conversion drops < 20% (revenue goes up overall)

### Experiment 2: Add "Lite" Tier at $10/month
**Features:** 3 hours transcription, 50 chat messages, no screen vision  
**Hypothesis:** Lower barrier to entry increases conversions  
**Test:** Offer for 3 months, measure uptake  
**Win if:** Lite users convert to Pro later + overall revenue increases

### Experiment 3: Annual Only (No Monthly)
**Hypothesis:** Students commit to full year if only option  
**Test:** A/B test annual-only vs monthly-option  
**Win if:** More total revenue from annual commitments

---

## 📞 Questions to Track

**Ask yourself monthly:**
1. What's my cost per free user? (Optimize if > $1)
2. What's my cost per paid user? (Optimize if > 30% of revenue)
3. What's my conversion rate? (Red flag if < 3%)
4. What's my gross margin? (Healthy is > 70%)
5. What's my payback period? (Should be < 6 months)
6. Can I afford to grow? (Positive unit economics?)

**If any of these are trending wrong, pause growth and fix economics first.**

---

**Remember: You can't grow your way out of bad unit economics. Fix the fundamentals first, then scale.** 📈

https://desktop-goose.en.softonic.com/?ex=RAMP-3582.3&rex=true reference but this one only for fun and distraction, while mine will be for efficiency and focus and support

I want to create sort of a Desktop overlay mini Ducky companion that will be able to interract with a person via clicking on the Ducky.

features: can listen to your lectures, take notes, help study and work.
- listens to the surroundings via your pc when you ask it to do so and writes down everything that was spoken into a file in DEsktop app. 
- has a Duckly AI chat where you can ask it questions as if you speak to AI, ask questions about whats going on on the screen and how to do certain task.
- also can act as antistrees pc pet which you can feed, click, and interact as with your own little friend during hard times.
- most of the time duck will be walking on your screen, or if you choose to it will stay in one place on the screen or can be a deafult desktop app that you open when needed, it will be in settings how you want it to be working for people who just need efficiency tools, but not a duck pet.
- Duck Pomodoro timer, periods, tracking, notes and etc for focus and efficiency working.

how i see it. 
the duck pet walks on your screen from time to time, has animations of just wondering, scrapping its back with mouth, making asmost silent duck sweet sounds with interwals and animation of duck opening mouth.
When user clicks on the duck by cursor it opens a small window with chat input (with field to ask question, option to record sounds from microfone) near it and stops moving and just looks at you with friendly intention

---

## 🚀 Your Next Steps:

### This Week:
1. **Read the full PRD.md** (give yourself 2 hours to digest)
2. **Decide on commitment** - Can you realistically do 20+ hours/week for 4 weeks?
3. **Budget check** - Confirm you have $500-1000 for APIs during beta testing
4. **Get duck animation** - Commission on Fiverr (~$50-200) or find free Lottie placeholder
5. **Register domain** - Check if `portflow.ai` is available ($12/year)

### Week 1 (Starting Monday):
1. Follow **QUICK_START.md** Day 1-2 instructions
2. Set up Electron + React + TypeScript boilerplate
3. Get duck window with Lottie animation working
4. Join Electron Discord for support

### Before You Start Coding:
- **Create Figma mockups** (or sketch on paper) of the duck + control panel
- **Write down your "why"** - When you're frustrated at 2am debugging Electron, remember why this matters
- **Find an accountability buddy** - Someone to check in with weekly on progress

---

## 📊 My Honest Assessment:

**Can you build this?** Yes, technically feasible with your chosen stack.

**Can you ship in 4 weeks?** Yes, IF you:
- Cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding in MVP)
- Use cloud Whisper (not local) to save time
- Use Clerk (not custom auth) to ship faster
- Accept "good enough" for first version

**Can you make money?** Yes, IF you:
- Nail the target audience (students genuinely need this)
- Achieve 5%+ conversion (freemium limits must create urgency)
- Keep users for 6+ months (retention is everything)
- Get distribution right (TikTok + Reddit + Product Hunt)

**Can you compete with Otter.ai / Notion AI?** Yes, because:
- They don't have the emotional connection (your duck)
- They don't focus on students specifically (you do)
- They don't work well for in-person lectures (your killer feature)
- They're expensive ($17-20/mo) - you match on price but add cuteness

**My confidence level:** 7/10

**Why not 10/10?** Because:
- Distribution is hard (getting your first 1,000 users requires creativity)
- Retention is unknown (will students stick around after midterms?)
- Conversion depends on feature execution (screen vision AI must be compelling)

**But this is a SOLID idea with real potential.** I've seen worse ideas get funded and succeed.

---

## 🤔 One Final Question Before You Start:

**What's your personal connection to this problem?**

The best founders build products they wish existed. Do you:
- Struggle with note-taking in lectures yourself?
- Feel lonely studying alone?
- Want a cute companion while coding/studying?

If yes → your passion will carry you through the hard parts.

If no → you'll need exceptional discipline to push through when it's not fun.

**User**

Some changes: 
I will do  custom animation and duck asset to my project. (not Lottie), but my own.
the name of the project is duck4u.com "Duck4u".
update just name, i just messed up that i started doing it in folder named portflow-ai, it is not connected with it. 


---

**Cursor**

Got it! Let me update all the documentation to reflect **Duck4u** as the project name and custom animation instead of Lottie. I'll update all the key files now.

```markdown
# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Portflow adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Portflow works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (Lottie animations) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Lottie-web for animations
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- CSS animations for smooth movement
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**

- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes

- **Commands:**
  - "Review my notes from [date]"
  - "Create flashcards from today's lecture"
  - "Explain [concept] in simple terms"
- **Context awareness:** Has access to user's saved transcripts (with permission)

**Technical:**
- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Portflow works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 👥 Target Audience

**Primary:** University students (Bachelor's/Master's), ages 18-26  
**Geography:** Global, English-first (expand languages later)  
**Psychographics:**
- Studies alone frequently (remote learning or library)
- Feels overwhelmed by information in lectures
- Values aesthetic, cute interfaces (grew up with Discord, Notion)
- Willing to pay for tools that genuinely help them succeed
- Privacy-conscious but pragmatic

**User Personas:**

### Persona 1: "Stressed Sarah" (Bachelor's, Year 2)
- Takes 5 classes, struggles to keep up with note-taking
- Studies alone in her dorm, feels isolated
- Uses Notion but doesn't have time to organize properly
- Budget: $15-20/month if it actually works

### Persona 2: "Grad School Greg" (Master's, Year 1)

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (Lottie animations) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Lottie-web for animations
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- CSS animations for smooth movement
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes

  - **Settings:** Duck behavior, audio settings, file paths

**Chat Section:**
- Text input field at bottom
- Microphone button for voice input (uses Web Speech API for command recognition)
- Chat history displays above
- "See Screen" toggle button (activates computer vision mode)
- Example prompts:
  - "Summarize my last lecture notes"
  - "Quiz me on [topic]"
  - "What's on my screen?" (if screen vision enabled)

**Record Section:**
- Big "Start Recording" button
- Live transcription preview (last 100 characters)
- Timer showing recording length

- **Commands:**
  - "Review my notes from [date]"
  - "Create flashcards from today's lecture"
  - "Explain [concept] in simple terms"
- **Context awareness:** Has access to user's saved transcripts (with permission)

**Technical:**
- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (Lottie animations) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Lottie-web for animations
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- CSS animations for smooth movement
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings

- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`

  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Lottie-web for animations
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- CSS animations for smooth movement
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

---

### **Phase 5: Cross-Platform (Months 6-9)**

- Mac support (should be easy with Electron)
- Linux support (more challenging, smaller market)
- Mobile companion app (iOS/Android) - **optional**

---

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### **Visual Identity**

**Colors:**
- Primary: Warm yellow (#FFD93D) - friendly, energetic
- Secondary: Soft blue (#6BCF9B) - calming, productive
- Background: Light mode default, dark mode available
- UI: Glass-morphism effects (blurred backgrounds, subtle shadows)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Inter Bold
- Body: Inter Regular
- Code/Transcripts: JetBrains Mono

**Duck Design:**
- Rubber duck aesthetic (classic yellow)
- Big friendly eyes
- Round, non-threatening proportions
- Smooth animations (no jerky movements)

---

### **UX Principles**

1. **Non-intrusive:** Duck should feel helpful, not annoying
2. **Quick access:** One click to open control panel, one click to start recording
3. **Clear feedback:** Always show what's happening (recording indicator, AI thinking state)
4. **Forgiving:** Easy to undo, delete, or retry actions
5. **Delightful details:** Smooth animations, satisfying sounds, easter eggs

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder

- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### **Visual Identity**

**Colors:**
- Primary: Warm yellow (#FFD93D) - friendly, energetic
- Secondary: Soft blue (#6BCF9B) - calming, productive
- Background: Light mode default, dark mode available
- UI: Glass-morphism effects (blurred backgrounds, subtle shadows)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Inter Bold
- Body: Inter Regular

**Duck Design:**
- Rubber duck aesthetic (classic yellow)
- Big friendly eyes
- Round, non-threatening proportions
- Smooth animations (no jerky movements)

---

### **UX Principles**

1. **Non-intrusive:** Duck should feel helpful, not annoying
2. **Quick access:** One click to open control panel, one click to start recording
3. **Clear feedback:** Always show what's happening (recording indicator, AI thinking state)
4. **Forgiving:** Easy to undo, delete, or retry actions
5. **Delightful details:** Smooth animations, satisfying sounds, easter eggs

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder

- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Portflow = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

---

### 3. **Control Panel (Mini Window)** 🎛️
**Purpose:** Hub for all duck interactions

**Design:**
- Small window (300px × 400px) that appears next to duck when clicked
- Blurred glass-morphism background (modern aesthetic)
- Tabs/sections:
  - **Chat:** AI chat interface
  - **Record:** Lecture transcription controls
  - **Stats:** Study time tracking (simple timer)
  - **Settings:** Duck behavior, audio settings, file paths

**Chat Section:**
- Text input field at bottom
- Microphone button for voice input (uses Web Speech API for command recognition)
- Chat history displays above
- "See Screen" toggle button (activates computer vision mode)
- Example prompts:
  - "Summarize my last lecture notes"
  - "Quiz me on [topic]"
  - "What's on my screen?" (if screen vision enabled)

**Record Section:**
- Big "Start Recording" button
- Live transcription preview (last 100 characters)
- Timer showing recording length
- "Enhance with AI" button (appears after stopping)

- **Commands:**
  - "Review my notes from [date]"
  - "Create flashcards from today's lecture"
  - "Explain [concept] in simple terms"
- **Context awareness:** Has access to user's saved transcripts (with permission)

**Technical:**
- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Duck4u = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

   - r/SideProject: "Launched my Electron app after 4 weeks"
```

```markdown
# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings
   - Key concepts highlighted
   - Summary at the top
   - Potential exam questions
8. Enhanced notes saved as `.md` file with formatting

**Technical Implementation:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Use Web Audio API to capture system microphone
- Buffer audio in 30-second chunks
- Visual waveform indicator so user knows it's working

**Transcription:**
- **Local Whisper Model:** Use `whisper.cpp` bindings for Electron (via N-API)
- Model: `whisper-base` (74MB download) for speed vs accuracy balance
- Fallback: If local fails, offer cloud Whisper API (consumes AI credits)
- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**
- Default save location: `~/Documents/Portflow Notes/`
- Naming convention: `Lecture_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.txt`
- In-app file browser to view past notes
- Search function across all notes

**Usage Limits (Freemium vs Paid):**
- **Free:** 60 minutes of transcription/month, AI enhancement limited to 3 times/month
- **Paid ($20/mo):** Unlimited transcription, 20 hours of AI enhancement/month

---

### 3. **Control Panel (Mini Window)** 🎛️
**Purpose:** Hub for all duck interactions

**Design:**
- Small window (300px × 400px) that appears next to duck when clicked
- Blurred glass-morphism background (modern aesthetic)
- Tabs/sections:
  - **Chat:** AI chat interface
  - **Record:** Lecture transcription controls

  - **Settings:** Duck behavior, audio settings, file paths

**Chat Section:**
- Text input field at bottom
- Microphone button for voice input (uses Web Speech API for command recognition)
- Chat history displays above
- "See Screen" toggle button (activates computer vision mode)
- Example prompts:
  - "Summarize my last lecture notes"
  - "Quiz me on [topic]"
  - "What's on my screen?" (if screen vision enabled)

**Record Section:**
- Big "Start Recording" button
- Live transcription preview (last 100 characters)

  - "Create flashcards from today's lecture"
  - "Explain [concept] in simple terms"
- **Context awareness:** Has access to user's saved transcripts (with permission)

**Technical:**
- OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API
- System prompt defines duck's personality:
  ```
  You are Ducky, a friendly and encouraging study companion. You're helpful but not patronizing. 
  You love learning and want to help your friend succeed. Use casual language and occasional 
  duck puns if appropriate. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs max).
  ```
- Conversation history stored locally in SQLite (last 50 messages)
- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Duck4u = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Do you have an animation already, or should I recommend places to commission one (~$50-200)?

7. **Name:** Are we sticking with "Portflow AI" or still brainstorming? (portflow.ai domain is $12/year on Namecheap)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

# Duck4u - Product Requirements Document
## The AI-Powered Productivity Duck Companion

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 4 weeks

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What:** Duck4u is a desktop companion app featuring an animated rubber duck that combines emotional support with powerful productivity tools for students. It's positioned as your friendly study buddy that helps you take better notes, stay focused, and feel less alone during long study sessions.

**Why:** Gen Z/Alpha students struggle with loneliness while studying, poor note-taking in lectures, and maintaining focus. Existing tools (Otter.ai, Notion AI) are sterile and transactional. Duck4u adds emotional connection through a cute companion while delivering real utility.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Your study buddy who never judges, always helps, and makes productivity actually enjoyable."*

**Unique Angle:**  
Unlike meeting transcription tools, Duck4u works for **in-person lectures** - students can open their laptop, activate the duck, and get transcription + AI study assistance even when they're sitting in a physical classroom.

---

## 🎨 Core Features (MVP - Phase 1)

### 1. **The Duck Companion** 🦆
**Purpose:** Emotional support + interface to tools

**Behavior:**
- Animated duck (custom animations/sprites) living in a frameless, always-on-top Electron window
- **Idle state:** Duck walks slowly in a defined "safe zone" (bottom 10% of screen, or user-defined corner)
- **Animations:**
  - Waddling walk cycle (loops every 3-5 seconds)
  - Scratching back with beak (random intervals, 2-3 min)
  - Looking around curiously
  - Soft, occasional "quack" sound (volume < 15%, toggleable)
- **Size:** ~80-120px width, stays compact
- **Click interaction:** When clicked, duck stops moving and opens the Control Panel mini-window next to it

**Settings:**
- Toggle between "Roaming Mode" (walks around) and "Stationary Mode" (stays in corner)
- "Work Mode" (duck hides, just tray icon)
- Customize duck appearance (locked behind premium tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Custom sprite animations or CSS animations (created by developer)
- Electron frameless window with `transparent: true` and `alwaysOnTop: true`
- Canvas or CSS for rendering duck animation
- Simple state machine for behavior switching

---

### 2. **Lecture Transcription + AI Notes** 📝
**Purpose:** Turn spoken lectures into searchable, organized notes

**User Flow:**
1. Student opens laptop in lecture hall or at home watching recorded lecture
2. Clicks duck → Control Panel appears
3. Clicks "Start Recording Lecture" (red record button)
4. Duck shows recording indicator (pulsing red dot on duck's collar)
5. Transcription runs in real-time using local Whisper model
6. When stopped, transcription is saved as `.txt` file in user-defined folder
7. User can optionally click "Enhance with AI" → sends transcript to GPT-4 for:
   - Structured outline with headings

- Real-time streaming transcription with 2-3 second latency
- Automatically detects pauses for punctuation

**AI Enhancement:**
- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4-turbo API (cheaper than GPT-4, almost as good)
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format:
  ```
  You are a study assistant. Format this lecture transcript into clear notes:
  - Create a hierarchical outline
  - Highlight key concepts in **bold**
  - Add a 3-5 bullet point summary at the top
  - Suggest 3 potential exam questions
  ```
- Token limit: ~8K tokens per request (limits to ~1 hour lecture)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10 per hour of lecture

**File Management:**

- Token optimization: Summarize older conversations to maintain context without bloating costs

**Usage Limits:**
- **Free:** 10 messages/day
- **Paid:** 200 messages/day

---

### 5. **Basic Interaction & Stress Relief** 🌟
**Purpose:** Make studying less lonely

**MVP Interactions:**
- **Click duck:** Opens control panel
- **Right-click duck:** Quick menu (Hide, Settings, Quit)
- **Drag duck:** Move to different position (stays there until app restart)
- **Pet duck (future):** Click and hold for 2 seconds → duck plays happy animation

**Sound Design:**
- Very occasional soft quacks (ambient, not annoying)
- Satisfying UI sounds (clicks, dings when tasks complete)
- All sounds < 20% volume, fully mutable

**No feeding/gamification in MVP** - keep it simple. Focus on utility first.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly OUT of Scope for MVP

These are great ideas for Phase 2+, but cutting them now:

❌ Pomodoro timer (too generic, existing apps do this)  
❌ Full pet simulation (feeding, levels, customization)  
❌ Screen recording/capture for **every** interaction  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Mobile companion app  
❌ Team/social features  
❌ Calendar integration  
❌ Flashcard system  
❌ Custom duck skins (save for monetization later)  
❌ Linux support in MVP

### **Data Flow Examples**

**Example 1: Recording a Lecture**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" in Control Panel
2. Control Panel (Renderer) → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process activates microphone via Web Audio API
4. Audio chunks streamed to whisper.cpp in 30-sec intervals
5. Transcribed text chunks sent back to Renderer via IPC
6. Renderer displays real-time transcript preview
7. On stop, full transcript saved to SQLite + user's file system

**Example 2: AI Chat with Screen Context**
1. User types question + enables "See Screen"
2. Control Panel → IPC → Main Process
3. Main Process captures screen via `desktopCapturer` (requires permission prompt)
4. Screenshot sent to backend (Supabase Edge Function)
5. Edge Function forwards to OpenAI GPT-4-vision API
6. Response streamed back to user
7. Usage logged in database (for limit tracking)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Core Principles**
1. **Explicit consent always:** Nothing records without user clicking a button
2. **Local-first:** Transcription runs locally (Whisper), no audio sent to servers
3. **Transparent data usage:** Tell users exactly what's sent where
4. **No hidden data storage:** User data encrypted, they can delete anytime

### **Data Flows**

| Data Type | Where It Goes | Why | User Control |
|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| **Audio recording** | Local Whisper model only | Transcription | Can delete files anytime |
| **Transcripts** | Local SQLite + user's files | Storage & search | Full ownership |
| **AI Chat messages** | OpenAI API (via Supabase proxy) | Get responses | Can disable, delete history |
| **Screenshots** | Sent to Supabase → OpenAI Vision API | Screen analysis | Only when "See Screen" enabled |
| **User account info** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth & billing | Can export/delete via settings |
| **Anonymous usage stats** | PostHog | Improve product | Can opt out in settings |

### **What We DON'T Store on Servers**
- ❌ Audio files (never leave device)
- ❌ Full transcripts (unless user opts into cloud backup - Phase 2)
- ❌ Screenshots (processed & discarded immediately)
- ❌ Chat context beyond current session

### **Compliance**
- GDPR-ready (EU users can request data export/deletion)
- COPPA-compliant (age gate: must be 13+)
- Terms clearly state: "Your study notes are yours. We process data to provide AI features but don't store it."

### **Security Measures**
- API keys stored in Electron's `safeStorage` (encrypted)
- HTTPS only for all network requests
- No eval() or remote code execution
- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk)
- Code signing for distributed builds (prevents tampering)

---

---

### **Revenue Projections (Conservative)**

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users after Month 3
- 10,000 users after Month 12
- 5% conversion to Pro (industry avg for freemium)
- 0.5% conversion to Premium

**Month 12:**
- Free users: 9,450 (cost: server only, ~$500/mo)
- Pro users: 500 × $20 = **$10,000/mo**
- Premium users: 50 × $35 = **$1,750/mo**
- **Total MRR: $11,750/mo**
- **Annual Run Rate: ~$141,000**

**Costs (Month 12):**
- OpenAI API: ~$2,000/mo (optimized with caching, local Whisper)
- Supabase: ~$500/mo (database, auth, edge functions)
- Servers: ~$200/mo (if needed)
- Stripe fees (2.9%): ~$340/mo
- **Total costs: ~$3,040/mo**

**Net Revenue: ~$8,700/mo** (74% margin) 💰

---

### **Why Students Will Pay $20/month**

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Otter.ai Pro: $16.99/mo (but no cute duck, no screen vision)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (but no transcription, no study focus)
- Notion AI: $10/mo (but no transcription, no chat)

**Duck4u = All three + emotional support for $20/mo**

**Psychological triggers:**
- "If this helps me pass my exams, it's worth 1 coffee per week"
- Sunk cost fallacy once they record 50+ hours of lectures
- Social proof: "My friends all use it"

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

### **North Star Metric:**
**Weekly Active Study Hours** - Total hours users record lectures or use AI chat per week

**Why:** This measures actual engagement and value delivery, not vanity metrics

---

### **Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)**

1. **Activation:** % of new users who record their first lecture within 3 days
   - Target: 40%+ (if lower, onboarding is broken)

2. **Retention:**
   - Day 7: 30%+
   - Day 30: 15%+
   - Month 3: 10%+ (these are your champions)

3. **Conversion:** Free → Paid within 30 days
   - Target: 5% (industry standard for freemium)

4. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate
   - Target: 15-25% month-over-month in first year

5. **NPS Score:** "How likely are you to recommend Portflow?"
   - Target: 40+ (good), 50+ (great)

---

### **Secondary Metrics (Health Indicators)**

- Average transcription length (longer = more valuable)
- AI chat messages per user per day (engagement)
- Duck interaction rate (clicks, right-clicks)
- Support ticket volume (quality issues)
- Churn rate (monthly cancellations)

---

### **Actionable Thresholds**

| Metric | Red Flag | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Activation < 25% | Onboarding is confusing | User testing, tutorial improvements |
| Day 7 retention < 20% | Not enough value delivered | Survey users, improve core features |
| Conversion < 2% | Freemium limits too generous OR product not valuable enough | A/B test pricing, add more paid features |
| Churn > 10%/mo | Product not sticky | Exit interviews, feature prioritization |

---

**Duck Design:**
- Rubber duck aesthetic (classic yellow)
- Big friendly eyes
- Round, non-threatening proportions
- Smooth animations (no jerky movements)

---

### **UX Principles**

1. **Non-intrusive:** Duck should feel helpful, not annoying
2. **Quick access:** One click to open control panel, one click to start recording
3. **Clear feedback:** Always show what's happening (recording indicator, AI thinking state)
4. **Forgiving:** Easy to undo, delete, or retry actions
5. **Delightful details:** Smooth animations, satisfying sounds, easter eggs

---

## 🐛 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Whisper.cpp fails on some PCs** | High | Fallback to cloud Whisper API, show clear error |
| **OpenAI API costs explode** | High | Aggressive caching, token limits, use GPT-4-turbo mini for basic tasks |
| **Students find duck annoying** | Medium | Easy toggle to "Work Mode" (hide duck), listen to feedback |
| **Low conversion (free is too good)** | High | A/B test limits, add more premium features (screen vision) |
| **Competitors copy quickly** | Medium | Build community loyalty, focus on polish & trust |
| **Audio privacy backlash** | Medium | Over-communicate privacy practices, never record without permission |
| **Electron app too large** | Low | Optimize build, use dynamic imports, compress assets |
| **Struggle to reach target users** | High | Invest in TikTok/Instagram, partner with influencers, double down on channels that work |

---

## 🔧 Open Technical Questions

**Need to decide during development:**

1. **Whisper Model Size:**
   - Base (74MB, faster) vs Small (244MB, more accurate)?
   - → Test both, let Pro users choose?

2. **Voice Input:**
   - Web Speech API (free, Chrome only) vs Whisper for commands?
   - → Start with Web Speech, add Whisper if users complain

3. **Update Strategy:**
   - Auto-update (Electron-updater) or manual?
   - → Auto-update for bug fixes, prompt for feature updates

4. **Installer Size:**
   - Include Whisper model in installer (larger) or download on first run (slower)?
   - → Download on first run with progress bar

5. **Multi-monitor:**
   - Should duck be able to move between monitors?
   - → Yes, but save last position per monitor

6. **Analytics:**
   - Self-host PostHog (more work) or use cloud (easier)?
   - → Cloud for MVP, self-host if privacy concerns arise

---

## 💬 Questions for You

Before we start building, let me confirm a few things:

1. **Your dev skills:** Are you comfortable with React + TypeScript? Or do you need a simpler stack?

2. **Budget for APIs:** You mentioned $20/user subscription, but are you okay spending ~$500-1000 on OpenAI API during beta testing? (Need to front this before revenue)

3. **Design:** Do you have design skills (Figma)? Or should we use a UI kit (shadcn/ui) to speed up?

4. **Time commitment:** Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the next 4 weeks?

5. **Backend preference:** Supabase (easier, managed) or custom backend (more control, more work)?

6. **Duck animation:** Creating custom animation yourself (confirmed)

7. **Name:** Duck4u (duck4u.com domain - check availability)

---

## ✅ Summary: Is This Realistic?

**Yes, if you scope correctly.**

**MVP in 4 weeks is doable** with these constraints:
- You focus 100% (no other projects)
- You use existing libraries (no reinventing wheels)
- You accept "good enough" for first version
- You cut ruthlessly (no Pomodoro, no pet feeding, no flashcards in MVP)

**The path to $10K MRR in 12 months is realistic** if:
- Students actually find the duck + transcription valuable (validate in beta)
- You nail distribution (TikTok virality or university partnerships)
- You iterate based on user feedback (don't fall in love with your ideas)

**This is better than 90% of side projects because:**
- Clear target audience (students)
- Solves real pain (note-taking sucks)
- Emotional hook (cute duck) + utility (AI tools)
- Multiple revenue paths (freemium, premium, future: university licenses)

---

## 🦆 Final Thoughts

You've got a solid foundation here. The key is **shipping fast and learning from real users**. 

Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Ship the MVP in 4 weeks, even if it's rough. Get it in front of 100 students and see if they:
1. Use it more than once
2. Tell their friends
3. Pay for Pro

If yes to all three → you've got something. Double down.

If no → pivot based on what you learn.

**The duck is your differentiator, but the transcription is your hook.** Make sure both are excellent.

Ready to start building? Let's tackle those questions above and then we can set up the project structure. 🚀

```

Now let me update TECH_ALTERNATIVES.md to reflect custom animations:

```markdown
# Technology Alternatives & Trade-offs

This document lists alternative tech choices you can switch to if the recommended stack doesn't work for you.

---

- Lower memory usage (~50-100MB RAM)
- Better security (Rust backend)
- Faster startup

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem, fewer packages
- Need to learn some Rust for advanced features
- Newer (less mature than Electron)
- Webview differences across platforms can cause bugs

**Use When:** You care about performance & bundle size more than speed of development

**Switch Cost:** Medium (different APIs, but frontend stays same)

---

### Option 3: **Native (C++/Qt or .NET)**
**What:** Build truly native apps

**Pros:**
- Best performance
- Smallest footprint
- Native look & feel

**Cons:**
- WAY harder to develop
- No code reuse across platforms
- Takes 3-6 months instead of 4 weeks

**Use When:** You're a masochist (don't do this for MVP)

---

## 🎨 Frontend Framework

### Option 1: **React + TypeScript** ⭐ (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Industry standard, tons of jobs/resources
- Great TypeScript support
- Huge component library ecosystem
- Hooks make state management elegant

- Re-renders can cause performance issues if not careful
- JSX syntax takes getting used to

**Use When:** You want mainstream tech with best ecosystem

---

### Option 2: **Vue.js + TypeScript**
**Pros:**
- Easier learning curve than React
- Cleaner template syntax
- Better built-in state management (Pinia)
- Smaller bundle size

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem than React
- Fewer Electron-specific resources
- TypeScript support not as mature

**Use When:** You prefer Vue's syntax or are already familiar with it

**Switch Cost:** Low (concepts are similar, mostly syntax changes)

---

### Option 3: **Svelte + TypeScript**
**Pros:**
- Best performance (compiles to vanilla JS)
- Least code to write
- Built-in animations
- Smallest bundle size

**Cons:**
- Smallest ecosystem of the three
- Fewer ready-made components
- Less Electron examples

**Use When:** You optimize for bundle size and simplicity

**Switch Cost:** Medium (different mental model, no virtual DOM)

---

## 🎬 Animations

### Option 1: **Custom Sprites/CSS Animations** ⭐ (Your Choice)
**Pros:**
- Full creative control
- No external dependencies
- Can be pixel art or vector (your choice)
- Direct manipulation of every frame
- Free (you create it)

**Cons:**
- Requires design/animation skills
- More manual work per animation
- Sprite sheets can be larger files for detailed animations

**Use When:** You have design skills and want unique, custom animations (your approach)

---

### Option 2: **Lottie**
**Pros:**
- Vector animations (scale to any size)
- Smooth 60fps playback
- Small file sizes (~20-100KB)
- Easy to control (play, pause, speed)
- Export from After Effects

**Cons:**
- Need to hire animator or buy animations
- Learning curve for After Effects
- External dependency (lottie-web package)

**Use When:** You want professional, smooth animations but don't want to create them yourself

---

### Option 3: **CSS Animations + Sprites (Pre-made)**
**Pros:**
- Free (you control everything)
- No external dependencies
- Can be pixel art (retro aesthetic)

**Cons:**
- More manual work
- Harder to make complex animations
- Larger file sizes for detailed animations

**Use When:** You have design skills and want full control

**Switch Cost:** Very Low (just change animation code)

---

### Option 3: **WebGL / PixiJS**
**Pros:**
- Most powerful (3D possible)
- Best performance for complex scenes
- Can do particle effects

**Cons:**
- Overkill for a duck walking
- Harder to implement
- Larger bundle size

**Use When:** You want 3D duck or crazy visual effects (probably never)

---

## 🗣️ Speech-to-Text (Transcription)

### Option 1: **OpenAI Whisper API (Cloud)** ⭐ (Recommended for MVP)
**Pros:**
- Easiest to implement (just API call)
- Excellent accuracy
- Handles 90+ languages
- Fast (real-time streaming)

**Cons:**
- Costs money ($0.006/minute = $0.36/hour)
- Requires internet connection
- Audio sent to OpenAI servers (privacy concern)

**Use When:** You want to ship fast and test the idea

**Cost:** ~$0.10-0.15 per hour of lecture (with GPT-4 enhancement)

---

### Option 2: **whisper.cpp (Local)**
**Pros:**
- Free (runs on user's computer)
- Works offline
- Privacy-friendly (no data leaves device)
- Good accuracy (same model as cloud)

**Cons:**
- Complex to integrate with Electron
- Requires downloading ~74MB-1.5GB model
- Slower on older computers (might not be real-time)
- Uses significant CPU/battery

**Use When:** You've validated the product and want to reduce costs

**Switch Cost:** High (need to compile binaries, create installers with models)

**Recommendation:** Start with cloud, add local option in Phase 2

---

### Option 3: **Web Speech API (Browser Built-in)**
**Pros:**
- Free
- Zero setup
- Good for short voice commands

**Cons:**
- Terrible accuracy for long lectures
- Chrome-only (no Firefox support)
- Requires internet
- Not suitable for production transcription

**Use When:** Only for voice commands ("Hey Ducky, start recording"), NOT for lecture transcription

---

### Option 4: **AssemblyAI**
**Pros:**
- Similar to Whisper but cheaper ($0.00025/second = $0.015/minute)
- Better speaker diarization (who said what)
- Sentiment analysis built-in

**Cons:**
- Slightly less accurate than Whisper
- Smaller company (risk of shutdown)

**Use When:** You want to save money at scale

**Switch Cost:** Very Low (just change API endpoint)

---

**The best tech is the tech you ship with.** Don't bikeshed.

---

## 🤔 Questions?

If you're unsure which tech to use, ask yourself:

1. **Do I need to ship fast or optimize?** (Ship fast = use recommended stack)
2. **Do I know this tech already?** (If yes, use what you know)
3. **Will this decision matter in 6 months?** (If no, don't overthink it)

**When in doubt, stick with the PRD recommendations.** They're chosen for a balance of speed, cost, and reliability.

---

**Remember: The goal is to ship and learn, not to build the perfect architecture.** 🚀

## 💡 When to Switch

**Don't switch before MVP ships.** Use the recommended stack even if it's not perfect.

**Consider switching when:**
1. **Costs are killing margins** → Switch to cheaper AI (GPT-4 → Gemini Pro)
2. **Bundle size complaints** → Switch to Tauri
3. **Performance issues** → Switch to local Whisper
4. **Privacy becomes selling point** → Switch to local LLM (maybe)

**The best tech is the tech you ship with.** Don't bikeshed.

---

## 🤔 Questions?

If you're unsure which tech to use, ask yourself:

1. **Do I need to ship fast or optimize?** (Ship fast = use recommended stack)
2. **Do I know this tech already?** (If yes, use what you know)
3. **Will this decision matter in 6 months?** (If no, don't overthink it)

**When in doubt, stick with the PRD recommendations.** They're chosen for a balance of speed, cost, and reliability.

---

**Remember: The goal is to ship and learn, not to build the perfect architecture.** 🚀

- Fixed costs: $500
- **Total Costs: $10,150**

**Net Profit: $1,600/month = $19,200/year** ✅ (14% margin - better!)

---

## 🚨 The Free User Problem

**The Reality:** Free users cost you money. At 10,000 free users, you're spending **$7,800/month** to support them.

**Why this is okay:**
1. **Freemium funnel:** Free users convert to paid over time
2. **Word of mouth:** Free users bring in paid users
3. **Data & feedback:** Free users help improve product
4. **Scale efficiency:** Costs drop as you negotiate better rates

**When to worry:**
- If conversion rate drops below 3% → tighten free tier limits
- If free users don't convert after 90 days → they never will, consider limits

---

## 🎯 Break-Even Analysis

**Question:** How many users do you need to break even?

### Fixed Costs (Monthly):
- Server/infrastructure: $100-500
- Tools (Figma, analytics, etc.): $50
- Your time: (not counted for MVP, but eventually you'll want salary)

**Minimum Revenue Needed:**
- Fixed costs: ~$500/month
- Variable costs: ~$3,000/month (for 3,000 free users at early stage)
- **Total: $3,500/month to break even**

**Required Paid Users:**
- If only Pro ($20/mo, $15 profit): **233 paid users**
- Mix of Pro + Premium (avg $17 profit): **206 paid users**

**Required Total Users (at 5% conversion):**
- **206 ÷ 0.05 = 4,120 total users to break even**

**Conclusion:** You need ~4,000-5,000 users to stop losing money. Achievable in Month 3-4 if growth is good.

---

## 💰 Revenue Milestones

| MRR | Total Users (estimated) | Paid Users | What This Means |
|-----|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|

| $100,000 | 100,000 | 5,000 | 🦄 Venture-backable scale |

---

## 📉 Optimization Strategies (Phase 2+)

### 1. **Local Whisper Option**
**Savings:** $1.80/user/month (for Pro users who opt in)  
**Implementation Cost:** 2 weeks of dev time  
**ROI:** At 500 Pro users with 50% adoption = $450/month saved

### 2. **GPT-4-turbo-mini for Simple Tasks**
**Savings:** ~$0.10/user/month  
**Implementation:** Use mini for: greetings, simple questions, summaries  
**ROI:** At 550 paid users = $55/month saved (small but easy win)

### 3. **Aggressive Caching**
**Savings:** ~$0.20/user/month (reduce duplicate AI calls)  
**Implementation:** Cache common questions, transcript patterns  
**ROI:** At 550 paid users = $110/month saved

### 4. **Annual Plans (15% discount)**
**Impact:** Get 12 months revenue upfront  
**Cash flow boost:** Sell $20/mo → $204/year (instead of $240)  
**User saves $36, you get cash now for growth**

### 5. **Tighten Free Tier After Validation**
**Current:** 60 min/month transcription  
**Optimized:** 30 min/month (still generous for testing)  
**Savings:** $0.18/free user/month × 10,000 = $1,800/month

---

## 📈 Growth Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Organic (Product Hunt, Reddit, Word of Mouth):**
- Cost: $0 (just your time)
- CAC: $0
- This is your growth strategy for first 6 months

**Paid Ads (Later, if needed):**
- Facebook/Instagram ads: $50-100 per paid customer (typical for SaaS)
- Google Search ads: $30-80 per paid customer
- TikTok ads: $20-40 per paid customer (best for Gen Z)

**Payback Period:**
- If CAC = $50 and monthly profit = $15/user
- Payback in 3.3 months
- **Must retain users for 6+ months to be profitable**

---

## 🎓 Student Discount Strategy

**Idea:** Offer 50% off for students with .edu email

**Pro Tier Student:** $10/month (instead of $20)

**Economics:**
- Revenue: $10
- Costs: $4.56
- Profit: $5.44/month (54% margin)
- Still profitable! ✅

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower ARPU (average revenue per user)
- But higher conversion rate (students are price-sensitive)
- More users = more word of mouth

**Recommendation:** Test 50% student discount in Month 3-4 if conversion is low

---

## 🏫 University Site License (Future Revenue Stream)

**Idea:** Sell to universities for all students

**Pricing:** $5/student/year (deeply discounted)

**Example:** Mid-size university with 20,000 students
- Revenue: 20,000 × $5 = **$100,000/year**
- Costs: 20,000 × $4 (annual) = $80,000
- Profit: $20,000/year (20% margin)

**Why universities would buy:**
- Supports student success (better note-taking = better grades)
- Modern, appealing tool (improves student satisfaction)
- Privacy-focused (not selling student data)
- Cheaper than Otter.ai or Notion AI for entire campus

**When to pursue:** Month 6+ after product is polished and has testimonials

---

## 📊 Real Numbers Examples

### Example 1: Modest Success (Realistic Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 10,000 total users
- 500 Pro ($20/mo)
- 50 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $11,750**
- **Costs: $11,040**
- **Net: $710/month = $8,520/year**

**Your salary:** $0 (reinvest in growth)  
**Runway:** Can operate indefinitely without outside funding

---

### Example 2: Good Success (Optimistic Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 25,000 total users
- 1,250 Pro ($20/mo)
- 125 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $29,375**
- **Costs: $24,000** (economies of scale, better rates)
- **Net: $5,375/month = $64,500/year**

**Your salary:** $40,000/year (livable)  
**Remaining:** $24,500 for growth, team, or profit

---

### Example 3: Exceptional Success (Viral Year 1)

**Month 12:**
- 100,000 total users
- 5,000 Pro ($20/mo)
- 500 Premium ($35/mo)
- **MRR: $117,500**
- **Costs: $85,000** (negotiated rates, mix of local/cloud processing)
- **Net: $32,500/month = $390,000/year**

**Your salary:** $100,000/year  
**Team:** Hire 2 engineers ($80K each)  
**Profit:** $50,000/year to reinvest

**This is venture-scale. You could raise a seed round at ~$5M valuation.**

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: OpenAI Raises Prices
**Current:** GPT-4-turbo is $0.01/1K tokens  
**If they raise to:** $0.02/1K tokens (2x)  
**Impact:** Costs per user double → margins compressed

**Mitigation:**
- Build in Claude as backup (competition keeps prices down)
- Move to local models for simple tasks
- Increase prices (users understand AI costs)

---

### Risk 2: Free Users Explode Without Conversions
**Scenario:** 50,000 free users, but only 1% convert (not 5%)  
**Costs:** 50,000 × $0.78 = $39,000/month  
**Revenue:** 500 paid × $20 avg = $10,000/month  
**Net: -$29,000/month** ❌ (Burning cash fast!)

**Mitigation:**
- Tighten free tier immediately (30 min → 15 min transcription)
- Add more paywalled features (flashcards, export, duck customization)
- Email campaigns to convert free users
- Consider killing free tier entirely and going paid-only (risky but stops bleeding)

---

### Risk 3: Churn is Higher Than Expected
**Healthy Churn:** 3-5% per month  
**Bad Churn:** 10%+ per month

**If 10% churn:** You need 10% new paid users/month just to stay flat

**Mitigation:**
- Exit interviews (ask why they left)
- Win-back campaigns (discount to return)
- Add features that increase stickiness (cloud sync, integrations)
- Annual plans (lock in for 12 months)

---

## 🧮 Quick Calculator

**Use this formula to estimate your costs:**

```
Monthly Cost = 
  (Free Users × $0.78) +
  (Pro Users × $4.56) +
  (Premium Users × $9.19) +
  Fixed Costs ($500)
```

**Monthly Revenue =**
```
  (Pro Users × $20) +
  (Premium Users × $35)
```

**Monthly Profit = Revenue - Costs**

**Gross Margin % = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100**

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Free users are expensive** ($0.78/month) but necessary for growth
2. **Pro users are profitable** (77% gross margin) and your main revenue
3. **Premium users are very profitable** (74% margin despite higher usage)
4. **You need ~4,000-5,000 total users to break even** (at 5% conversion)
5. **Unit economics work** if you can keep users for 6+ months
6. **Optimization matters** at scale (local Whisper saves $9K+/year at 500 users)
7. **Stripe fees hurt** ($0.88 per $20 transaction = 4.4%) but unavoidable
8. **Main cost driver is AI** (Whisper + GPT-4), so optimize this first

## 💡 Pricing Experiments to Try

### Experiment 1: Raise Pro to $25/month
**Hypothesis:** Students will pay for quality  
**Test:** Raise price for new users, keep existing at $20  
**Win if:** Conversion drops < 20% (revenue goes up overall)

### Experiment 2: Add "Lite" Tier at $10/month
**Features:** 3 hours transcription, 50 chat messages, no screen vision  
**Hypothesis:** Lower barrier to entry increases conversions  
**Test:** Offer for 3 months, measure uptake  
**Win if:** Lite users convert to Pro later + overall revenue increases

### Experiment 3: Annual Only (No Monthly)
**Hypothesis:** Students commit to full year if only option  
**Test:** A/B test annual-only vs monthly-option  
**Win if:** More total revenue from annual commitments

## 📞 Questions to Track

**Ask yourself monthly:**
1. What's my cost per free user? (Optimize if > $1)
2. What's my cost per paid user? (Optimize if > 30% of revenue)
3. What's my conversion rate? (Red flag if < 3%)
4. What's my gross margin? (Healthy is > 70%)
5. What's my payback period? (Should be < 6 months)
6. Can I afford to grow? (Positive unit economics?)

**If any of these are trending wrong, pause growth and fix economics first.**

---

**Remember: You can't grow your way out of bad unit economics. Fix the fundamentals first, then scale.** 📈

https://desktop-goose.en.softonic.com/?ex=RAMP-3582.3&rex=true reference but this one only for fun and distraction, while mine will be for efficiency and focus and support

I want to create sort of a Desktop overlay mini Ducky companion that will be able to interract with a person via clicking on the Ducky.

features: can listen to your lectures, take notes, help study and work.
- listens to the surroundings via your pc when you ask it to do so and writes down everything that was spoken into a file in DEsktop app. 
- has a Duckly AI chat where you can ask it questions as if you speak to AI, ask questions about whats going on on the screen and how to do certain task.
- also can act as antistrees pc pet which you can feed, click, and interact as with your own little friend during hard times.
- most of the time duck will be walking on your screen, or if you choose to it will stay in one place on the screen or can be a deafult desktop app that you open when needed, it will be in settings how you want it to be working for people who just need efficiency tools, but not a duck pet.
- Duck Pomodoro timer, periods, tracking, notes and etc for focus and efficiency working.
- yellow duck for programmers model
- can act as a conversation partner

how i see it. 
the duck pet walks on your screen from time to time, has animations of just wondering, scrapping its back with mouth, making asmost silent duck sweet sounds with interwals and animation of duck opening mouth.
When user clicks on the duck by cursor it opens a small window with chat input (with field to ask question, option to record sounds from microfone) near it and stops moving and just looks at you with friendly intention

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **This Week:**
   - Check if duck4u.com is available (~$12/year)
   - Start designing custom duck sprite animations
   - Set up initial Electron + React boilerplate

2. **Animation Creation:**
   - Decide on style: pixel art, vector, or mixed
   - Create walk cycle (8-12 frames)
   - Create idle animations (scratching, looking around)
   - Create interaction states (happy, listening, thinking)
   - Export as sprite sheet or individual PNGs

3. **Week 1 Development:**
   - Follow QUICK_START.md Day 1-2 instructions
   - Set up project structure
   - Integrate custom duck animation into frameless window
   - Implement basic duck behaviors

### 💡 Animation Tips

**Tools You Can Use:**
- **Aseprite** ($20, best for pixel art)
- **Procreate** (iPad, great for frame-by-frame)
- **Adobe Animate** (vector animations)
- **Blender** (if you want 3D rendered to 2D sprites)
- **Krita** (free, good for digital animation)

**Sprite Sheet vs Individual Frames:**
- **Sprite Sheet:** Better performance, one file, requires CSS/Canvas
- **Individual Frames:** Easier to manage, larger file count

**Recommended Approach:**
- Create animations at 24fps (smooth enough)
- Export at 2x resolution for retina displays
- Use PNG with transparency
- Keep file sizes under 500KB total

### 📊 Cost Savings

**Before (Lottie approach):**
- Commission animation: $50-200
- lottie-web package: 0 cost (but dependency)
- **Total: $50-200**

**After (Custom approach):**
- Your time creating animation: $0 (but takes 2-5 hours)
- No external dependencies: $0
- Full control over design: Priceless
- **Total: $0**

**Trade-off:** Your time vs money. Since you're creating it yourself, you save $50-200 but invest 2-5 hours of design work.
