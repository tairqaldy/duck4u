I'll help you figure out which duck animations you need to draw. Let me check your project documentation to see what's required.

Based on your project documentation, here are the **duck animations you need to draw**:

## MVP (Phase 1) - Essential Animations:

1. **Idle/Waddling Walk Cycle** ‚≠ê (PRIORITY)
   - Duck walking slowly side to side
   - Should loop every 3-5 seconds
   - This is the main animation users will see

2. **Idle Stationary** 
   - Duck standing still (breathing animation)
   - For when user is in "Stationary Mode"

3. **Scratching/Grooming**
   - Duck scratching back with beak
   - Plays randomly every 2-3 minutes
   - Adds personality

4. **Looking Around**
   - Duck curiously turning head left/right
   - Short animation for variety

5. **Recording Indicator State**
   - Duck with a visual indicator (maybe collar or badge glowing red)
   - Shows when recording is active

6. **Clicked/Opening Panel**
   - Duck stops and faces forward (or toward panel)
   - Brief transition when user clicks

## Phase 2+ (Nice to Have Later):

7. **Happy/Being Petted** (Phase 3)
   - Duck closes eyes, looks content
   - Plays when user clicks and holds

8. **Excited/Celebration**
   - For milestones ("You studied 10 hours!")

You already have some example animations in your `assets/examples/duck-fav-style/` folder that show a good style reference. Based on those, you'd be drawing similar variations.

**For your MVP launch in 4 weeks, focus on animations 1-6 first.** You can add the emotional animations (7-8) in Phase 3 when you work on making the duck more lovable.

Would you like guidance on the technical specifications (sprite sheet dimensions, frame rates) or animation software recommendations for creating these?
