**Cursor**

I can see the error is related to a missing Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin. Let me check your PostCSS configuration and package.json to understand the issue.

I found the issue! You're using Tailwind CSS v4 (version 4.1.14), which requires a separate `@tailwindcss/postcss` package that isn't currently installed in your `package.json`.

**Solution:**

You need to install the `@tailwindcss/postcss` package. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```

Or if you prefer yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```

**Why this is happening:**

Tailwind CSS v4 changed its architecture and now requires the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin to be installed separately. Your `postcss.config.js` is correctly configured to use it, but the package just needs to be added to your dependencies.

After installing the package, your dev server should work properly!

**Note:** You're currently in **ask mode**. If you'd like me to help with additional setup or troubleshooting after installing the package, feel free to ask!

```shellscript
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```

```shellscript
yarn add -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```
